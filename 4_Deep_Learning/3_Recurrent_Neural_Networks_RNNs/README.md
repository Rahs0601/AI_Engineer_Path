# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

This section introduces Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are designed to process sequential data. It covers basic RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), along with their applications in natural language processing and time series analysis.
