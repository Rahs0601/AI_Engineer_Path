# Time Series Deep Learning

This section provides a comprehensive example of applying deep learning techniques to time series forecasting. It includes a Jupyter Notebook (`time_series_deep_learning_example.ipynb`) that covers:

-   **Data Generation**: Creating synthetic time series data.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding time series patterns.
-   **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing time series data for deep learning models, including sequence creation and train/validation/test splits.
-   **Model Definition**: Implementing a deep learning model (e.g., LSTM) for time series forecasting.
-   **Training and Validation**: Training the model and monitoring its performance.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizing Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization.
-   **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on unseen data.
-   **Model Saving and Loading**: Demonstrating how to persist and reuse trained models.

This example aims to provide a complete workflow from data to a deployable model for time series tasks.
