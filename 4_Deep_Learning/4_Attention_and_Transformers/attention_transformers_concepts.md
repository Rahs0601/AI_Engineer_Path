# Attention and Transformers Concepts

Attention mechanisms and Transformer architectures have revolutionized deep learning, especially in NLP, by allowing models to focus on relevant parts of input sequences.

## 1. Attention Mechanism

Attention allows a neural network to weigh the importance of different parts of its input. Instead of a single context vector, attention uses a weighted sum of encoder hidden states, where weights are learned.

### Key Concepts:

*   **Context Vector**: Weighted sum of encoder hidden states.
*   **Alignment Scores**: Determine how much attention to pay to each input part.
*   **Weighted Sum**: Combines encoder states based on alignment scores.

### Types:

*   **Additive Attention (Bahdanau)**
*   **Multiplicative Attention (Luong)**

### Advantages:

*   Handles long-range dependencies.
*   Provides interpretability.
*   Improves performance.

## 2. Transformer Architecture

The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) relies solely on attention, enabling parallel computation and superior performance.

### Key Components:

*   **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Processes input and generates output.
*   **Self-Attention**: Allows the model to weigh words within the same sequence for context.
    *   **Query (Q), Key (K), Value (V)**: Vectors for attention calculation.
    *   **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Core attention mechanism.
*   **Multi-Head Attention**: Performs multiple attention functions in parallel for diverse representations.
*   **Positional Encoding**: Incorporates token position information.
*   **Feed-Forward Networks**: Simple fully connected networks.
*   **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: For stable training and gradient flow.

### Advantages:

*   **Parallelization**: Faster training.
*   **Handles Long-Range Dependencies**: Effectively captures distant relationships.
*   **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Excellent results across NLP tasks.
*   **Scalability**: Supports very large models.

### Applications:

*   **NLP**: Machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis.
*   **Computer Vision**: Image recognition (ViT).
*   **Speech Recognition**.
