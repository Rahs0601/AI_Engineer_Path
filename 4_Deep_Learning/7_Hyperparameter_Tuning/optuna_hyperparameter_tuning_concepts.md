# Optuna for Hyperparameter Tuning

Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework. It automates the search for optimal hyperparameter values for machine learning models.

## Key Concepts

- **Study**: A study is a single optimization session. It manages the optimization process and stores the results.
- **Trial**: A trial is a single execution of an objective function with a specific set of hyperparameters.
- **Objective Function**: A function that takes a `trial` object as input, defines the model training and evaluation process, and returns the metric to be optimized (e.g., validation accuracy, loss).
- **Samplers**: Algorithms that propose new hyperparameter values for each trial (e.g., Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), Random Search).
- **Pruners**: Algorithms that automatically stop unpromising trials early during training (e.g., Median Pruner, Successive Halving Pruner).

## Features

- **Define-by-Run API**: Dynamically construct the search space for hyperparameters.
- **State-of-the-art Algorithms**: Includes efficient samplers and pruners.
- **Visualization**: Integrates with various plotting libraries to visualize optimization history.
- **Database Integration**: Store optimization results in a database for persistent storage and collaborative optimization.

## Basic Workflow

1.  Define an objective function that takes an `optuna.Trial` object.
2.  Inside the objective function, suggest hyperparameters using `trial.suggest_...()` methods.
3.  Train and evaluate your model using the suggested hyperparameters.
4.  Return the metric to be optimized.
5.  Create an Optuna study.
6.  Optimize the study by calling `study.optimize()` with the objective function.
